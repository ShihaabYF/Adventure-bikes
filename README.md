# Adventure-bikes
This is my second FlexBox project, it's almost identical in the design to the first one that is provided to us by The Odin Project.

I did collect all what I need before writing any line of code, and I did make an overall-design-layout, so I know what I want to make, and where should I lay each element in my page.
However earlier to this commit, I did know what to do (the overall design), but I didn't know how to do it, which caused me a lot of frustrating in the coding scope, from now on I'll try to do an overall-design_code for each part, something like pseudo-code.
