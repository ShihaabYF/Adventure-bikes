Adventure bikes:
	Requiring little more than a functional motorcycle and an eye for exploration, adventure motorcycling is riding in its purest form. Often associated with big motorcycles sporting knobby tires, adventure riding simply means venturing into the unknown on two wheels.
	Adventure motorcycles can range in size and engine displacement, but they need to be reliable and capable of carry you through the tough stuff and keep you rolling on your journey.
